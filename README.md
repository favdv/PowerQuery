# powerbi-powerquery-toolkit
This repository is used to store snippets of Power Query that other Power BI developers might also find of interest.

The repository is split between:
- generic snippets (as in they can be used for all kinds of scenarios)
- snippets relating specific tools (e.g. retrieving data from specific APIs)

Note that some snippets can be copied and used immediately, while others need some minor tweaking for your specific environment. For example: API calls using the Web.Contents function must have the domain hard coded, otherwise auto-refresh will not work.
